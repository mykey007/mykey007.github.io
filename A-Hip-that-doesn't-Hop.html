		<h1>A Hip that Doesn't Hop</h1>
		<p>In less than three days I will lose my status as a person and once again become a patient.</p>

		<p>Becoming a patient ages you faster than Father Time. I will become instantly dependent on people I do not even know to eat, sleep, get well, recover, and turn over in a hard, rubber-covered bed.</p>

		<p>I will need all the help I can get begging for pain-killers, sipping on ice, peeing, fighting the nightmares and learning how to move and sit and walk all over again.</p>

		<p>I am having my left hip replaced. This is a gruesome operation. I will need blood, oxygen and the super-human skill of a surgeon. I have a lot more faith in the surgeon than I do in my courage and recovery abilities.</p>

		<p>The last time, about three years ago, I was in the hospital for the right hip. That hip took a long time to fall apart. It took years and many career moves and four children and one marriage and more deaths of loved ones than I can think about.</p>

		<p>I did not know what was going to happen. It was scary, but the fear was buffered by the unknown. Not this time.</p>

		<p>This time, I know what to expect. People tell me that should make it better. It doesn’t. It makes it worse because I am such a coward, especially about physical pain. I am not much better dealing with emotional pain, either.</p>

		<p>But the thought of how much pain and suffering I will be experiencing, even in brief doses, cripples me inside and outside. I can’t pretend to put up a good, brave front. There is nothing even remotely brave in my entire being.</p>

		<p>This hip has only taken three years to fall apart. The pieces of me are breaking off like bark from a very old, very bent tree.</p>

		<p>As one of the first of the Baby Boomers, I have already lost the battle with time and age and deterioration. Now I am facing what a general might call an “orderly” withdrawal.</p>

		<p>In my heart of hearts I know that it will be a head-long retreat, a crazy, screaming rout. A disaster. I know it is coming, but I can’t help it.</p>

		<p>The only appreciation I have developed is a new and uncanny understanding of how important the hip is to a human being. Tell the truth: who has ever even thought about their hips unless you are facing the imminent removal of yours?</p>

		<p>Yet, you can do almost nothing that does not involve the moving of your hips. You can’t sit,  walk, run, climb steps, drive a car, stand in place, sweep the front yard, feel comfortable in a chair, get up from the table, move around in bed, hug your wife or child, lift a light bag, or even sit properly on a toilet without using your hips in multiple ways.</p>

		<p>That’s why it hurts so much when you need a new hip.</p>
		<p>I know. I need one.</p>
		<p>I will check back every day if I can to, to let you know what’s happening with the hip and the surgery.</p>

		<p>I am doing this to help me keep from going crazy with the fear and anticipation and dread. I am also doing it to share these moments and this experience with my fellow Baby Boomers. All of our clocks are ticking.</p>
