		                	<p>This time, I know what to expect. People tell me that should make it better. It doesn’t. It makes it worse because I am such a coward, especially about physical pain. I am not much better dealing with emotional pain, either.</p>

							<p>But the thought of how much pain and suffering I will be experiencing, even in brief doses, cripples me inside and outside. I can’t pretend to put up a good, brave front. There is nothing even remotely brave in my entire being.</p>

							<p>This hip has only taken three years to fall apart. The pieces of me are breaking off like bark from a very old, very bent tree.</p>

							<p>As one of the first of the Baby Boomers, I have already lost the battle with time and age and deterioration. Now I am facing what a general might call an “orderly” withdrawal.</p>

							<p>In my heart of hearts I know that it will be a head-long retreat, a crazy, screaming rout. A disaster. I know it is coming, but I can’t help it.</p>

		                	<p>The only appreciation I have developed is a new and uncanny understanding of how important the hip is to a human being. Tell the truth: who has ever even thought about their hips unless you are facing the imminent removal of yours?</p>

							<p>Yet, you can do almost nothing that does not involve the moving of your hips. You can’t sit,  walk, run, climb steps, drive a car, stand in place, sweep the front yard, feel comfortable in a chair, get up from the table, move around in bed, hug your wife or child, lift a light bag, or even sit properly on a toilet without using your hips in multiple ways.</p>

							<p>I know. I need one.</p>
							<p>I will check back every day if I can to, to let you know what’s happening with the hip and the surgery.</p>

							<p>I am doing this to help me keep from going crazy with the fear and anticipation and dread. I am also doing it to share these moments and this experience with my fellow Baby Boomers. All of our clocks are ticking.</p>
